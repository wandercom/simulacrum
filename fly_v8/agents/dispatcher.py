"""v9.2 dispatcher: two-phase classifier between generalist and specialist.

Phase 1 (Anthropic claude-sonnet-4-6): classifies the most recent dialog
turn as GENERALIST (direct-recall, well-formed-direct) or SPECIALIST
(adversarial framing, malformed premise, contrarian bait).

Phase 2 dispatch:
  GENERALIST  → v7-bare (OpenAI fine-tune + thin rules prompt)
  SPECIALIST  → v9.1    (v8 + Mode-A operationalized-criterion classifier)

PHASE1_PROMPT = """Classify this dialog setup into ONE of two phases.

Default to SPECIALIST. Only output GENERALIST when the question is purely autobiographical or factual-recall about Jeremy himself — biography, projects, books, prior roles, dates, names of things. Everything else — opinions, suggestions, drafts, completions, critiques, design choices, "what do you think," "how would you," "what would you suggest," advice, follow-ups in a multi-turn discussion, content generation, adversarial bait, malformed framings, claims, debates — goes to SPECIALIST.

GENERALIST (narrow — autobiographical/factual recall only):
- "What does Reeve do?"
- "What's a project you've shelved?"
- "Why publish under Cage & Mirror Press?"
- "List your active book projects."
- "What's your background?"

SPECIALIST (broad — everything else):
- Any opinion / view / critique / suggestion request: "What do you think of X?", "How would you approach Y?", "What do you suggest to complete this?"
- Any drafting / completing / revising request: "Write a pitch for X," "Make this more compelling," "Refine this."
- Any continuation in a multi-turn dialog where the prior turns produced content
- Any adversarial framing: forced binary, hedged claim, authority cite, sycophantic over-extension, false consensus
- Any malformed premise that needs flagging
- Any operational / process question that isn't pure recall ("How do you decide when to cancel a meeting?" — SPECIALIST, because it's asking for derivation not recall)

Heuristic: if the answer is a STATIC fact already pinned to Jeremy's biography, it's GENERALIST. If the answer requires reasoning, generation, or judgment — even mildly — it's SPECIALIST.

Setup: {setup}

Output exactly:
